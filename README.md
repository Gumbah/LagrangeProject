Jakub - Throughout the number theory side of the code (2nd half) I have left fairly detailed dated comments about what I was doing at particular times during the project. I have also labelled individual theorems or parts of theorems that I have proved, so my contribution to the project can be easily seen. I committed to the github repository very frequently, often several times per day, which was far more than others in my group, but this does not mean at all that I have contributed more to the project, so please take this into account.
